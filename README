# `wmm-qbf`

This tool is designed to evaluate instances of Event Structure Memory
models to QBF queries.

## Running the tool

We have included binaries for running on Linux. You can most easily
run the program by sourcing the `setenv` script to include the solver
on your $PATH; followed by running the `./regression.py` script.

```
pip3 install natsort # Required by regression.py
. setenv
./regression.py
```

## Dependencies

  OCaml 4.04
  opam install batteries extlib menhir ocamlgraph oUnit ppx_deriving

For development, it also helps to install the following:

  opam install merlin utop
  opam user-setup install

## Usage

```
./Pride.byte <infiles>
  -e                   enumerate all executions
  --dump-query         print QBF query before executing
  --model              pick a model. Default is j+r
  --list-models        print list of models
  --list-enum-models   print list of models which support enumeration with -e
  --no-exec            skip running the solver. Useful with --dump-query option
  -                    read from stdin
  -help                Display this list of options
  --help               Display this list of options
